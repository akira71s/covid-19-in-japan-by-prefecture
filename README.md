# Correlationship between population & #positive COVID-19 cases in Japan by prefecture

## COVID-19 cases in Japan by prefecture (47prefectures)

In this project, I'm going to analyze the correlationship between population (& population density) and the
number of positive COVID-19 cases in Japan, by prefecture. (Japan has 47 prefectures.Tokyo is one of them.)
I will only focus on the total COVID-19 patients by prefecture, not on changes in the trend at daily or weekly
basis.

## Data source
Source: ./covid-19-japan-2022-01-04.csv
The csv file can be downloaded from https://www.stopcovid19.jp/tableview.html.
This is a portal website for COVID-19 run by the Japanese governmental organization.
There is no potential for personally identifiable distinctions as it only contains data 'by prefecture'.
